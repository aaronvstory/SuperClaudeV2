```

### Troubleshooting Command Issues

**Command not working as expected?**
- Try adding `--help` to see all options
- Use `--preview` or `--safe` flags when available
- Start with smaller scope (single file vs. entire project)

**Analysis taking too long?**
- Use `--focus` to narrow scope
- Try `--depth quick` instead of deep analysis
- Analyze smaller directories first

**Build/test commands failing?**
- Make sure your tools are in PATH
- Check that config files are in expected locations
- Try running the underlying commands directly first

**Not sure which command to use?**
- Use `/index` to browse available commands
- Look at the Quick Reference table above
- Try the most specific command first, then broader ones

---

## Final Notes üìù

**Remember:**
- Commands work best when you're specific about what you want
- Use `--preview` and `--safe` flags liberally
- Start small (single files) before running on entire projects
- These commands enhance your workflow, they don't replace understanding your tools

**Still rough around the edges:**
- Complex orchestration (spawn, task) may not work perfectly
- Some analysis depends heavily on your project setup
- Error handling could be better in some commands

**Getting better all the time:**
- We actively improve commands based on user feedback
- Newer commands (analyze, improve) tend to work better
- Documentation and examples are constantly being updated

**Need help?** Check the GitHub issues or create a new one if you're stuck! üöÄ

*Happy coding! We hope these commands make your development workflow a bit smoother. üôÇ*
