## üí° Pro Tips for Maximum Efficiency

### 1. Persona Chaining
Combine multiple personas for comprehensive solutions:
```
@architect "Design authentication system" ‚Üí 
@security "Review for vulnerabilities" ‚Üí 
@frontend "Create UI components" ‚Üí 
@backend "Implement API endpoints" ‚Üí 
@qa "Generate test cases"
```

### 2. Command Sequences
Use commands in logical sequences:
```
/analyze codebase/ ‚Üí /improve --issues ‚Üí /test --coverage ‚Üí /document --api
```

### 3. Context Persistence
Use `/task` for multi-session projects:
```
/task create "E-commerce Platform" --epic
/task continue "E-commerce Platform" --phase "authentication"
```

### 4. Intelligent Troubleshooting
Use `/troubleshoot` with specific context:
```
/troubleshoot "React app crashes on form submission" --verbose --suggest-fixes
```
